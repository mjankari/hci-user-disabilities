\section{Introduction}

In today's world, technology plays an increasingly important role in our lives.
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field dedicated to bridging the gap
between humans and the machines they use. HCI specialists focus on designing and
evaluating computer systems, paying particular attention to how users interact
with them. Their goal is to create technology that is not just functional, but
also intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use. This involves a deep
understanding of human capabilities and limitations, encompassing how we
perceive information, learn new systems, and interact with the world around us.

The importance of HCI is undeniable. By prioritizing user-centered design
principles, HCI helps create interfaces that are clear, intuitive, and easy to
learn. This minimizes frustration and errors for users of all abilities.
However, a significant portion of the population has disabilities that can
hinder their interaction with traditional interfaces. As this population
continues to grow, the need for inclusive design becomes ever more critical.

This paper aims to explore the principles and best practices for designing
interfaces that are accessible to users with disabilities. By understanding
these principles and applying them effectively, we can ensure that everyone has
the opportunity to benefit from the power of technology.
