\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the importance of designing interfaces that are accessible
to users with disabilities. Following the POUR principles (Perceivable,
Operable, Understandable, and Robust) ensures everyone can perceive information,
operate the interface, understand content, and navigate with ease. Design
considerations for specific disabilities and user-centered design with active
user involvement are crucial. User testing methods like assistive technology
testing and screen reader testing help identify and address usability issues.
While future trends in accessible HCI include AI-powered tools and advancements
in interaction methods, ensuring accessibility in AR and VR technologies will be
essential for their widespread adoption. By embracing these trends and
user-centered design, we can continuously improve HCI accessibility and empower
everyone to benefit from technology.
